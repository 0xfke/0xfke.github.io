Welcome to my latest cybersecurity journey! I am launching a comprehensive TryHackMe walkthrough series, covering different rooms across various cybersecurity fields. This walkthrough aims to guide both beginners and advanced learners through structured hands-on challenges, enhancing their hacking, security skills and also my writing and reporting skills. Each week, I will try to upload three detailed walkthrough videos along with corresponding write-ups to ensure a deeper understanding of each topic.

## **Why This Series?**

TryHackMe is one of the best platforms for practical cybersecurity learning. However, many learners struggle with finding a structured path or understanding certain concepts deeply. This series will:

- Provide step-by-step explanations for each room.
    
- Cover different cybersecurity domains such as web exploitation, privilege escalation, malware analysis, and Active Directory security.
    
- Offer practical insights and additional learning resources.
    
- Help beginners build a strong foundation while also benefiting advanced learners.
    

## **Balancing Studies, Work, and Content Creation**

As a busy student with various commitments, balancing studies, work, and content creation is a challenge. However, my passion for cybersecurity drives me to push forward. This series is not just about teaching others—it’s also my way of mastering key cybersecurity concepts. By explaining these walkthroughs, I reinforce my own knowledge while helping others learn. Although I will try my best to maintain a consistent upload schedule, there may be times when academic and work responsibilities slow things down. I appreciate your patience and support on this journey!

**How This Will Work**

1. **Room Selection:** I will carefully pick Free TryHackMe rooms, categorized by skill level and domain.
    
2. **Content Creation:** Each room will have:
    
    - A detailed video walkthrough.
        
    - A structured blog write-up covering key concepts, commands, and methodologies.
        
3. **Weekly Schedule:** Videos and blogs will be uploaded per week (as much as my schedule allows).
    
4. **Community Engagement:** Viewers can ask questions, discuss techniques, and suggest topics for future walkthroughs.
    


**What’s Next?** In the next blog post, I will reveal the first set of rooms we’ll be covering. Stay tuned for exciting, hands-on cybersecurity content! If you’re eager to learn and grow in the field, make sure to follow along and engage with the content.
