# Investigating Ransomware with ProcDOT | TryHackMe Dunkle Materie

![duk-2](Images/Dunk-2.png)


The firewall alerted the Security Operations Center that one of the machines at the Sales department, which stores all the customers' data, contacted the malicious domains over the network. When the Security Analysts looked closely, the data sent to the domains contained suspicious base64-encoded strings. The Analysts involved the Incident Response team in pulling the Process Monitor and network traffic data to determine if the host is infected. But once they got on the machine, they knew it was a ransomware attack by looking at the wallpaper and reading the ransomware note.

Can you find more evidence of compromise on the host and what ransomware was involved in the attack?

## Question One

- Provide the two PIDs spawned from the malicious executable.Â (In the order as they appear in the analysis tool)


> Spin up the machine, and it will give you a split-screen view. Then, continue with the challenge.
- Go to C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\procdot_1_22_57_windows\win64 and run procdot as administrator

- Then enter the file address of the .csv file from procmon which is located at C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Analysis Files\Logfile.csv to the field and launch the render configuration.

- After close inspection of the Process names and googling found that the names exploreer.exe has typo and they had d/t PID so we got our first answer's for

## Question Two

- Scroll down and you will find process name called system with PID 4 double-click on the **System** process (PID 4), then click **Refresh**, the visualization will display a graphical representation of system events.

### What You Get from ProcDOT Visualization

When you launch **ProcDOT** and analyze the **System** process (PID 4), the visualization provides a powerful way to understand process activities and interactions.

### Key Insights from the Visualization:

1. **Process Behavior Mapping**  
   - Displays how processes interact with each other, making it easier to track suspicious activities.  

2. **Clear Dependency Graphs**  
   - Shows parent-child process relationships, helping to analyze execution flow and malware propagation.  

3. **Network Activity Insights**  
   - Highlights connections made by processes, revealing potential Command & Control (C2) communications.  

4. **File System Interactions**  
   - Identifies file modifications, deletions, or new file creations by specific processes.  

5. **Anomaly Detection**  
   - Helps in spotting unusual behaviors, such as unexpected script executions or unauthorized file access.  

This graphical approach simplifies **malware detection, security incident investigation, and system activity analysis**, allowing for quicker and more effective threat hunting.

- when you find this don't panic, if it looks complex just zoom in using *ctr + scroll*

 - Zoom in and scroll until you find the exploreer.exe, then right click it and choose details Boom you have found **answer for question 2** which is Provide the full path where the ransomware initially got executed? (Include the full path in your answer).

## Question Three

- This ransomware transfers the information about the compromised system and the encryption results to two domains over HTTP POST. What are the two C2 domains? (**no space in the answer**)
- As we see here there are 3 possible outgoing connections to C2 domains, looking at each Ip using treat intel tools like virus total we find  interesting evidences. 

![Dunk-10.png](Images/Dunk-10.png)

- directly going to virus total and investigating we find the first malicious domain to be 

![Dunk-11.png](Images/Dunk-11.png)

- upon close inspection there is no domain name for other two using online tools, we should use the .pcap file and search for **HTTP POST** request.


![Dunk-12.png](Images/Dunk-12.png)

- Lets resolve the network address name by going into view/name resolution/resolve network address. Then we find our next domain name.

## Question Four
