# Cyber Night CTF Day 01 Walkthrough Challenge 1

**Level**: Easy üü¢
**Technique**:  EXIF-based Steganography
**Tool**: [Exiftool](https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool)
**Point: 100**

**Description:**

What if your eyes are missing more than just pixels? Within an ordinary file lies an extraordinary secret. Steganography hides messages in plain sight ‚Äî can you spot the hidden truth?

### Concept Behind the Challenge

#### üí° What Is EXIF-based Steganography?

EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) is a standard for storing metadata in image files, such as camera details, GPS coordinates, date, and other properties. **EXIF-based steganography** involves hiding information, such as a flag, within this metadata, which is invisible in the image itself but can be extracted with tools like **ExifTool**.

In this challenge, the **flag** is hidden inside the **metadata of an image** file. The key to discovering it lies in extracting and analyzing the **EXIF metadata** of the image file.

#### üåê OSINT Relevance:

EXIF metadata is often **overlooked in publicly posted files** on social media, blogs, or websites. Attackers may use EXIF-based steganography to embed covert messages in **images** shared online, making it harder to detect at first glance. For **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)** gathering, analyzing metadata from publicly available images can provide critical information ‚Äî from hidden messages to **location data** or even **timestamps** that reveal more about a target.

This string looks like it is encrypted using base64 from the structure at the end "=". taking it and decoding it gives us our first flag.

You can also take the encrypted string and go to [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) web which is basically a decryption and encryption tools repo.
