# Exploring Windows Sandbox: A Secure Testing Environment for Cybersecurity Enthusiasts

As cybersecurity researchers and ethical hackers, we often need to interact with suspicious software in a safe and controlled environment. The challenge lies in ensuring our primary system remains untouched. **Windows Sandbox** addresses this need by providing a lightweight, isolated desktop environment built into Windows 10 and 11 Pro and Enterprise editions.

## What is Windows Sandbox?

**Windows Sandbox** is a temporary, secure environment that allows users to run untrusted applications without affecting their host system. Every time it is launched, it spins up a clean installation of Windows. Once it is closed, all changes are discarded — including files, settings, and installed applications.

This makes it ideal for:

- Testing unknown or potentially harmful software
    
- Analyzing malware behavior
    
- Running suspicious attachments
    
- Isolating sensitive operations from the main system
    

## Key Features of Windows Sandbox

- **Integrated in Windows**: No additional downloads are needed. It is included in Pro and Enterprise versions.
    
- **Clean Environment**: Every session starts with a fresh instance of Windows.
    
- **Disposable by Nature**: Nothing persists after the sandbox is closed.
    
- **Hardware-Isolated**: Uses Microsoft’s hypervisor and hardware virtualization for kernel isolation.
    
- **Resource Efficient**: Shares the kernel with the host and utilizes smart memory management and virtual GPU capabilities.
    

## System Requirements

Before installing Windows Sandbox, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build 18305 or later)
    
- **Architecture**: 64-bit
    
- **RAM**: Minimum 4 GB (8 GB or more recommended)
    
- **CPU**: Minimum 2 cores (4 with hyperthreading recommended)
    
- **Storage**: At least 1 GB free disk space (SSD preferred)
    
- **BIOS**: Virtualization enabled
    

## How to Install Windows Sandbox

You can install Windows Sandbox in one of two ways:

### Method 1: Via Control Panel

1. Open **Control Panel > Programs > Turn Windows features on or off**
    
2. Check **Windows Sandbox**
    
3. Click OK, and restart your computer when prompted
    

### Method 2: Using PowerShell

Open PowerShell with administrative privileges and run:

```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName "Containers-DisposableClientVM" -All -Online
```

Restart your computer after the command completes.

Once installed, you can launch Windows Sandbox from the Start Menu by typing **Windows Sandbox**.
